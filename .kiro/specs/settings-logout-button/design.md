# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation of a logout button in the settings page. The feature will integrate with the existing authentication system and provide users with a secure way to log out from their account directly from the settings interface.

## Architecture

The logout button will be implemented as a new component within the existing settings page structure. It will leverage the current `AuthContext` which already provides a `logout` method that handles session cleanup and redirection.

### Key Components:
- **LogoutButton Component**: A reusable button component that handles the logout action
- **Settings Page Integration**: Integration of the logout button into the existing settings page layout
- **Authentication Flow**: Utilization of the existing `AuthContext.logout()` method

## Components and Interfaces

### LogoutButton Component

```typescript
interface LogoutButtonProps {
  className?: string;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  showConfirmation?: boolean;
}

interface LogoutButtonState {
  isLoggingOut: boolean;
  showConfirmDialog: boolean;
}
```

The component will:
- Display a clearly labeled logout button
- Show loading state during logout process
- Optionally show confirmation dialog before logout
- Handle errors gracefully
- Prevent multiple simultaneous logout requests

### Settings Page Integration

The logout button will be integrated into the existing settings page (`app/src/app/settings/page.tsx`) by:
- Adding a new "Account" section to the settings tabs
- Placing the logout button in a prominent but safe location
- Ensuring it's only visible to authenticated users
- Following the existing UI patterns and styling

### Authentication Integration

The implementation will use the existing `AuthContext` methods:
- `logout()`: Main logout method that clears session data and redirects
- `user`: To check authentication status
- `isLoading`: To handle loading states appropriately

## Data Models

No new data models are required. The implementation will use existing types:

```typescript
// From existing AuthContext
interface User {
  _id: string;
  username: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  email: string;
  // ... other existing fields
}

interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  isLoading: boolean;
  // ... other existing methods
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios:
1. **Network Error**: When logout API call fails
2. **Session Already Expired**: When user session is already invalid
3. **Multiple Logout Attempts**: Preventing concurrent logout requests
4. **Redirect Failure**: When post-logout redirect fails

### Error Handling Strategy:
- Display user-friendly error messages using the existing modal system
- Graceful degradation: Clear local data even if API call fails
- Prevent UI interaction during logout process
- Log errors for debugging while maintaining user privacy

### Error Recovery:
- Retry mechanism for network failures
- Fallback to local session clearing if API fails
- Manual redirect option if automatic redirect fails

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- LogoutButton component rendering and interaction
- Loading states and disabled states
- Error handling scenarios
- Confirmation dialog functionality

### Integration Tests:
- Settings page integration
- AuthContext interaction
- Modal system integration for confirmations and errors
- Navigation after logout

### End-to-End Tests:
- Complete logout flow from settings page
- Session cleanup verification
- Redirect behavior validation
- Error scenario handling

### Test Cases:
1. **Successful Logout**: User clicks logout, session clears, redirects to login
2. **Logout with Confirmation**: User sees confirmation dialog, confirms, logs out
3. **Logout Cancellation**: User cancels confirmation dialog, remains logged in
4. **Network Error**: API fails, local session still clears, user notified
5. **Already Logged Out**: Handle case where session expired during logout attempt
6. **Multiple Clicks**: Prevent multiple logout requests, show loading state

### Mock Scenarios:
- Mock AuthContext for isolated component testing
- Mock API responses for error scenarios
- Mock navigation for redirect testing

## Security Considerations

### Session Security:
- Complete session data clearing (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
- Token invalidation on server side
- Prevention of session replay attacks

### UI Security:
- Prevent logout during critical operations
- Clear sensitive data from component state
- Secure redirect to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities

### Data Protection:
- No sensitive data logging during logout process
- Secure cleanup of any cached user data
- Protection against CSRF attacks (using existing session tokens)

## Implementation Notes

### Styling and UX:
- Follow existing design system patterns from the current settings page
- Use consistent button styling with other settings actions
- Implement smooth loading transitions
- Provide clear visual feedback for all states

### Accessibility:
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast support for visual accessibility
- Clear focus indicators

### Performance:
- Minimal impact on settings page load time
- Efficient cleanup of resources during logout
- Optimized re-renders during state changes

### Browser Compatibility:
- Support for all browsers currently supported by the application
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Consistent behavior across different environments (Electron vs web)

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems:
- **AuthContext**: Primary integration point for logout functionality
- **Modal System**: For confirmations and error messages
- **Navigation**: For post-logout redirects
- **Settings Page**: UI integration point

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`: Existing logout endpoint
- No new API endpoints required

### State Management:
- Utilizes existing AuthContext state management
- No additional global state required
- Component-level state for UI interactions

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
- "Log out from all devices" option
- Session timeout warnings before forced logout
- Logout confirmation with session duration display
- Integration with "Remember me" functionality

### Scalability:
- Component designed for reuse in other parts of the application
- Extensible props interface for future customization needs
- Modular design for easy maintenance and updates
