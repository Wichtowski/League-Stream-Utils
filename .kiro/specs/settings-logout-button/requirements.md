# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a logout button to the settings page that allows users to securely log out of their account when clicked. The logout functionality should clear user session data and redirect the user to an appropriate page (login or home page).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see a logout button in the settings page, so that I can easily access the logout functionality when I need to end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user navigates to the settings page THEN the system SHALL display a logout button
2. WHEN the user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL NOT display the logout button in settings
3. WHEN the logout button is displayed THEN it SHALL be clearly labeled as "Logout" or similar
4. WHEN the logout button is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually distinct and easily identifiable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to click the logout button and be logged out immediately, so that my session is terminated securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all user session data
2. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL invalidate the user's authentication token
3. WHEN the logout process completes THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page or home page
4. WHEN the logout process fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the user is redirected after logout THEN they SHALL NOT be able to access protected pages without logging in again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the logout process to be secure and complete, so that no sensitive data remains accessible after I log out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all local storage related to user authentication
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all session storage related to user authentication
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear any cached user data
4. IF the application uses cookies for authentication THEN the system SHALL clear or invalidate authentication cookies
5. WHEN logout is complete THEN any subsequent API calls SHALL be treated as unauthenticated requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when I click the logout button, so that I know the system is processing my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (loading state, disabled button, etc.)
2. WHEN the logout process is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple logout requests
3. WHEN the logout process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation before redirecting
4. IF the logout process takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL maintain the loading state until completion or timeout
