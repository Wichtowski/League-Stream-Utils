# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stream Banner feature is a TV ticker-style component system for tournaments that displays dynamic content with a main title area and an infinite scrolling carousel at the bottom. This feature should follow the same administrative flow as the existing sponsors module, providing tournament organizers with the ability to create, edit, and manage banner content that appears on stream overlays.

2. WHEN a tournament organizer clicks "Add Banner" THEN the system SHALL display a form to create new banner content
3. WHEN a tournament organizer fills out banner details and saves THEN the system SHALL store the banner data and associate it with the tournament
4. WHEN a tournament organizer edits an existing banner THEN the system SHALL update the banner data in the database
5. WHEN a tournament organizer deletes a banner THEN the system SHALL remove the banner from the database and update the display

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stream viewer, I want to see dynamic banner content during tournament streams, so that I can stay informed about important announcements and information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the stream banner component loads THEN the system SHALL display the main title prominently at the top
2. WHEN the stream banner component loads THEN the system SHALL start an infinite carousel loop at the bottom
3. WHEN carousel items are displayed THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between items without interruption
4. WHEN no banner content is available THEN the system SHALL display a blank/empty state
5. WHEN banner content is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the stream banner system to follow the same patterns as the sponsors module, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the banner model THEN the system SHALL follow the same database schema patterns as sponsors
2. WHEN implementing API routes THEN the system SHALL follow the same REST API patterns as sponsors
3. WHEN implementing the management interface THEN the system SHALL follow the same UI/UX patterns as sponsors
4. WHEN implementing the display component THEN the system SHALL be reusable across different tournament contexts
5. WHEN implementing data validation THEN the system SHALL use consistent validation patterns with other modules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tournament organizer, I want to preview banner content before it goes live, so that I can ensure it displays correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the preview loads THEN the system SHALL show both the main title and carousel animation
3. WHEN banner settings are changed THEN the preview SHALL update in real-time
